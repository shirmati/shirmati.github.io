<p> My name is Shir. <br> 
	I'm a sofware developer by day, and a dancer/yogi by night.
</p>
<p>
	This blog is my next Challenge - <br>
	to share some of the knowledge and wisdom that I pick up along the way.
</p><p>
	I'm writing my code in whatever suits the need. <br>
	These days it's mostly Ruby (rails), and the amazing, not-so-beautiful, <br>
	you guessed it - Javascript.
</p><p>
	Since my favourite part of the R&D is the R, I like to document my learnings. <br>
	One day I've realized that I'm surrounded by an ever-growing  <br>
	number of Google Docs, alongside some sample code snippets that regards different subjects from the software world.
</p><p>
	And then, it hit me. <br>
	I should share this. If it helped me, it can, most likely, help somebody out there too.
</p><p>
	So, this is what this space is all about. <br>
	Hope you are excited, <br>
	I know I am.
